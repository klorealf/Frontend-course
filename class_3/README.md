# Layout With HTML and CSS

## Quick Warmup
- Let's use Codepen.io to practice CSS selectors.
- Create at least one div with an id, and four divs with a class.
- Use CSS to apply styling to the divs based on the id and class selectors.
- Bonus: Try implementing one or more styles using a CSS3 selector (first-child, nth-child, first-of-type, etc).

## Element Alignment
- To determine how we can align an element we have to first know what kind of element it is.
- Inline elements can be aligned as text, so with the `text-align` CSS property.
- Block elements can be aligned using the space around them - margin. A margin set to auto for both left and right will center the element in a container.

## The Grid Layout
- Most modern layouts operate on a standard 12-column grid system.
- If you break down any of the websites you know and love you will notice many variations on the 12 column grid.
- Each column in the grid can contain nested grids itself.
- If you want a larger box, you need to have a greater column offset.
- Here is a good pictorial to help you break it down:

## Group Exercise
- In groups of two, look up one website of your choice.
- Think about the layout they chose in terms of the grid system.
- Write down which column "offsets" were likely used, and where nested grids may be present.
- Review the mockup of the fashion blog located [here](img/fashion_blog_2.png) and do the same thing.

## Code-Along: Let's Create Our Own Grid
- We will create a 2, 4, and 6 column grid.
- We will try nesting a grid inside another grid.

## Preview of next week
- For homework next week you will be creating the fashion blog using your knowledge of layouts.
- The mockup of what you will be creating can be found [here](img/fashion_blog_2.png).
- Extra Reading: Have a look through the documentation for popular frontend frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation. Pay attention to how they implement the grid system.
